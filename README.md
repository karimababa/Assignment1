Hello! 
I first started by doing version 1, I added the text and picture, changed the background color and added committed the changes to the repo. 
I chose a fun subject of putting cute animals in the files because everyone loves animals!
I then did version 2 with the same steps, I added the text and picture and changed the background color as well, then I committed the changes to the repo. 
The last step was to add this read me file. I will also add the word doc with the link to this repo to the moodle page, with that I would have finished this assignment!
